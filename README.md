# cardGamesWithCats
One of my other final projects for my iOS Mobile Apps Development class, this one involved creating two different view controllers (a main view and a detailed view).  The main view displays a card that pits two cats against each other (tiger vs lion for example).  A cat class exists to allow cat objects to be created then they're stored in an array.  Hitting the new battle button allows the two cats to be changed to different cats (randomizing the cards).  The detailed view controller displays more information on the cat that is selected by the user (in this case the images act as buttons) and the user can see the cats picture, description and name.
